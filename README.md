This is a description of the Odin Recipes project for The Odin Project. The goal of 
this project is to demonstrate proficiency in html by creating a linked set of webpages
that outline and describe various recipes. There is a landing page used for navigations,
to each individual recipe page. Each recipe page contains a photo, description, and step
by step guide on how to cook the recipe.
